# hello-world
New to Github world, but not always new 
Hello, my name is Young, I am currently a PSU student in Data Analytics major, I am enthusiastic about learning something about machine learning. This is my first time to use Github. Wish I could quickly master it and utilize it as the hub of learning and practicing to help me go further in my academic area. First day to Github, intial note to log my starting point of Github journey. Good luck
